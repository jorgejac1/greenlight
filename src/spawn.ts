/**
 * Agent process spawner.
 *
 * Spawns an agent command in a given worktree directory and streams all
 * stdout+stderr to a log file. The process runs to completion; the resolved
 * value is the exit code.
 *
 * The default command is `claude --headless --print "<task>"` which sends the
 * task title as the first user message to Claude Code in headless mode.
 * Override with agentCmd/agentArgs for testing or alternative agents.
 *
 * Zero runtime dependencies — uses Node built-ins only.
