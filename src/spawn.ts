/**
 * Agent process spawner.
 *
 * Spawns an agent command in a given worktree directory and streams all
 * stdout+stderr to a log file. The process runs to completion; the resolved
 * value is the exit code.
 *
 * The default command is `claude --print "<task>"` which sends the
 * task title (optionally preceded by taskContext) as the first user message to
 * Claude Code in non-interactive mode.
 * Override with agentCmd/agentArgs for testing or alternative agents.
 * Use {task} in agentArgs as a placeholder that is replaced with the full
 * prompt (context + task title) at spawn time.
 *
 * Zero runtime dependencies — uses Node built-ins only.
